## Matrix Multiply

This program employs two different algorithms for multiplying (n x n) matrices.
User input is required for the size of the matrix and the values to fill each matrix with.
Each computation is timed, and the results are displayed in the output.
Based on my testing, the blocked algorithm should compute faster.

## How to use

Install Python 3.9.7 then run: 'python3 matrixUtils.py' and supply the input.
